# Assignment 2: The Shape of Things to Come & Hair Today

## Lab2A: The Shape of Things to Come

### Project Overview

This project, Lab2A, demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming principles in C# and .NET Framework. The focus is on creating a hierarchy of shapes using an abstract class, polymorphism, and modularized code.

#### Features

- **Abstract Class (Shape):**
  - Represents a single shape in the hierarchy.
  
- **Object Hierarchy:**
  - Classes for various shapes, including Rectangle, Square, Box, Cube, Ellipse, Circle, Cylinder, Sphere, Triangle, and Tetrahedron.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Prompts the user via a menu to create an instance of a shape.
  
- **Polymorphism and List Storage:**
  - Utilizes polymorphism to store shapes in a list.
  
- **Modularization:**
  - The Main method is highly modularized for clarity and maintainability.

#### Shape Classes

Each shape class (e.g., Square.cs, Circle.cs) implements:
- `SetData()`: Prompts the user to enter dimensions.
- `CalculateArea()`: Calculates the area or surface area.
- `CalculateVolume()`: Calculates the volume for three-dimensional shapes.
- `ToString()`: Overrides to print details in a table.

#### Instructions for Running the Program

1. Download the provided Shape.cs file.
2. Create a new .NET Framework Console Application project.
3. Add Shape.cs to the project.
4. Create separate class files for each shape class.
5. Implement the features mentioned in the project description.
6. Run the application and follow the prompts.

## Lab2B: Hair Today

### Project Overview

Lab2B demonstrates my ability to create a Windows Form App in C# and .NET Framework. The project involves designing a GUI for a hair salon pricing system.

#### Features

- **GUI Interface:**
  - Provides an interactive interface for determining pricing in a hair salon.

- **User Inputs:**
  - Select a hairdresser, services, client type, and number of client visits.

- **Pricing Logic:**
  - Calculates the total price based on selected options, hairdresser base rate, services rates, client type discount, and number of client visits.

- **Validation:**
  - Validates inputs, ensuring a positive integer for the number of client visits.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensures that at least one service is selected and a valid number of client visits is provided before calculating.

#### Instructions for Running the Program

1. Download the provided sample program.
2. Open the Lab2B project in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application.
4. Explore the GUI, selecting various options.
5. Observe how the total price is calculated based on the selected criteria.
